EBC4J is a generic Java API that can be used to implement event based components.
It builds upon the actions and events of the Events4J API and provides base and
helper classes that can be used to create EBCs for loosely coupled systems, e.g.
the implementation of a flow design. 

It is open source software released under the terms of the MIT License found in
